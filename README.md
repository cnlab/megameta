### Overview

This repository contains the Python and other code used in the _Neural Correlates of Message Effectiveness: A Mega-Analysis_ project in the Communication Neuroscience Lab at UPenn.

First and second level GLM models for fMRI task data were built using a custom `nipype` pipeline that incorporated `SPM12`.

* Details of the pipeline and examples of the configuration are detailed [here](doc/cnlab_pipeline.md)
